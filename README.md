This project is part of The Odin Project Curriculum:
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-restaurant-page

This is a restaurent page made using Webpack to bundle and serve assets in an optimized way.

All the content is served from JavaScript modules instead of being hardcoded in the HTML file.

The design is inspired from this beautiful design by DS Code:
